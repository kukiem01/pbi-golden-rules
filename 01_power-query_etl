DOC_01_PowerQuery_ETL
==========================

	Goal:
		- Maintainable, readable, performant transformation logic
		- Clear lineage and predictable structure

	IMPORTANT (PBIX reality)
		- For loaded tables, the Power Query query name == the model table name
		- Therefore:
			- Use TECHNICAL prefixes only for NON-LOADED queries:
				- Raw_
				- Stg_
				- DOC_
			- Use MODEL-FACING naming for LOADED tables:
				- Facts
				- Dimensions
				- Support tables used in visuals

	FOLDER STRUCTURE (Query Groups)
		- 00_Raw_Source
			- Raw data connections / entry points
			- Minimal transforms
		- 10_Staging
			- Intermediate transforms (cleaning, shaping, joins)
			- Referenced by final queries
		- 20_Model
			- Final analytical tables loaded into the model
			- Business names
		- 30_Support_UI
			- Disconnected/support tables for report UX
			- Loaded only if used (slicers/parameters/etc.)

	NAMING CONVENTIONS
		- Non-loaded queries (Enable Load = Off)
			- Raw_*		- External source entry queries
			- Stg_*		- Staging / intermediate queries
			- DOC_*		- Documentation queries
		- Loaded analytical tables (Enable Load = On)
			- Title Case with spaces
			- No technical prefixes visible in Fields pane

	DISCONNECTED / SUPPORT TABLES (Group 30) — ONE STANDARD
		- All disconnected/support tables MUST follow:
			- _UI <Short User Name> [v2] [(Page)]
		- Rules:
			- _UI
				- Marks the table as disconnected/support
				- Enables fast filtering/autocomplete in DAX by typing "_UI"
			- <Short User Name>
				- Concise and user-facing (optimized for Fields pane)
				- Describes what the user selects/controls
			- [v2] / [v3]
				- Only when multiple variants exist
			- [(Page)]
				- Only if strictly used on a single page
				- Otherwise omit (do not build core names around pages)
		- Examples:
			- _UI Time (YTD/MAT)
			- _UI Promo Mode
			- _UI Seg Order v2
			- _UI G2N Tooltip (Gross to Net)	- page-only example

	LOADING RULES
		- Disable Enable Load for:
			- Raw_*
			- Stg_*
			- DOC_*
			- Helpers not meant to exist as model tables
		- Enable load only for:
			- Final analytical tables
			- _UI tables actually used by slicers/parameters/visual logic

	EXTERNAL SOURCES FOR _UI TABLES (e.g., Excel on SharePoint)
		- Recommended flow:
			- Raw_*		(in 00_Raw_Source, load off)
				-> Reference
			- _UI ...	(in 30_Support_UI, load on if needed)
		- Use Stg_* only when:
			- Transforms are non-trivial
			- Logic is reused by multiple final tables

	INLINE _UI TABLES (no external source)
		- Place directly in 30_Support_UI as:
			- _UI ...
		- Split into Stg_ + _UI only when:
			- Inline payload is large
			- You want to separate raw inline data from transforms

	PERFORMANCE & RELIABILITY
		- Filter early; preserve query folding where possible
		- Expensive operations late:
			- sort
			- group
			- pivot
			- heavy merges
		- Prefer Reference over Duplicate
		- Set correct data types without breaking folding unnecessarily
