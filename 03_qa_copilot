DOC_02_Model
==========================

	Goal:
		- Self-service usability
		- Strong performance
		- Good AI/Q&A interpretation

	MODEL DESIGN
		- Star Schema preferred:
			- Dimensions filter facts
			- Facts store events/transactions
		- Relationships:
			- Single-direction by default
			- Bi-directional only when necessary and understood
			- Avoid many-to-many where possible (prefer bridge patterns)

	NAMING IN FIELDS PANE
		- Facts / dimensions:
			- Business-friendly names (Title Case with spaces)
		- Disconnected/support tables:
			- Always use the _UI standard (see DOC_01)
			- Keeps support tables grouped and searchable in DAX

	COLUMN VISIBILITY
		- Hide unless users truly need them:
			- technical IDs
			- relationship keys
		- Hide:
			- columns used only to support measures

	MEASURES
		- Use a dedicated measures table
		- Do NOT name it exactly "Measures" (may be reserved/blocked)
		- Recommended safe names:
			- Key Measures
			- All Measures
		- Organize measures with Display Folders:
			- Sales
			- Margin
			- Time Intelligence
			- etc.
