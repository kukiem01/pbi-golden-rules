05) PERFORMANCE — DIRECTQUERY, FOLDING, INCREMENTAL REFRESH
================================================================================

	Query folding (default)
		- Preserve folding whenever possible
		- Keep fold-friendly steps early:
			- select columns
			- filters
			- simple renames/types (connector-dependent)
		- Put expensive/non-foldable operations late, or move upstream (views)

	DirectQuery (especially Databricks)
		- DirectQuery relies on folding; non-foldable steps can break support or performance
		- Staging (Raw -> Stg -> Final) is allowed ONLY if the final loaded query still folds
		- Using Reference does not inherently break folding; non-foldable steps do
		- Validate with diagnostics/source query history (do not guess)

	Incremental refresh (where to implement)
		- Policy is configured on the FINAL loaded table (typically a fact table)
		- The RangeStart/RangeEnd filter should be applied as early as possible in the query chain
			- ideally immediately after Source in a Stg_ query referenced by the final table
		- Keep the date filter foldable
		- Use a safe boundary pattern:
			- DateTime >= RangeStart
			- DateTime <  RangeEnd
