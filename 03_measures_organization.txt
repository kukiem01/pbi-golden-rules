03) MEASURES — ORGANIZATION (GOLDEN RULES)
================================================================================

	Goal
		- Measures are easy to find, consistent to use, and safe to maintain

	One measures table
		- Keep measures in a dedicated table (do not scatter across facts/dims)
		- Recommended table names (safe):
			- Key Measures
			- All Measures
			- Metrics
		- Do NOT name the table exactly "Measures" (may be reserved/blocked)

	Display Folders (primary organization)
		- Use Display Folders as the standard (UI-only, safe refactor)
		- Use a stable folder taxonomy; examples:
			- Sales
			- Margin
			- Promo
			- Customer
			- Time Intelligence
			- Formatting
			- Tooltips

	Measure naming
		- Use business language (Title Case)
		- Keep names stable; avoid cryptic abbreviations
		- Prefer consistent patterns:
			- Total Sales
			- Sales YoY
			- Sales YTD
			- Margin %
			- Average Order Value

	Measure documentation
		- Fill Description for important measures:
			- definition (what it calculates)
			- filters/assumptions
			- unit (currency, percent, etc.)
			- grain (what it aggregates)

	Field Parameters
		- Use Field Parameters for user-driven switching of measures/dimensions
		- Store Field Parameter tables in 30_Support_UI and name them with _UI
